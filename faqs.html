<p class="title">How does the typhoon develop over time?</p>
<p class="subtitle">Typhoons form when strong winds blow into warm areas of the ocean. These winds pick up moisture and
  rise, bringing colder air with them. This creates pressure, causing the winds to move quickly. The winds revolve or
  spin around a central point known as an eye.</p>
<br>
<p class="title">How do the landforms and bodies of water affect the typhoon?</p>
<p class="subtitle">Typhoons are influenced by land forms and sea bodies based on the amount and type of energy they
  produce. In general, water and moisture have a significant impact on how the typhoon moves and how much rain, wind,
  and rotation to expect.</p>

<p class="title">What are the ways to mitigate the risk of a typhoon?</p>
<p class="subtitle">The ways to mitigate the risk of a typhoon is to always make sure that you have enough food and
  water for you and the family as once the typhoon occurs, you wonâ€™t be able to find food and water, due to floods and
  strong winds. Remember that we will also need some supplies such as flashlights, candles, or rechargeable fans (just
  in case the power goes out); plus the first aid kits and some medications. If you live in a house that is prone to
  landslides and floods, You may contact repairmen to fix flaws on your house and make it less prone, or, it would be
  better to move out somewhere more safe.</p>
